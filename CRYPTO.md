Gitmark transitions are on-chain committments that are recorded from one tranaction to another.

The transaction will go from a single transaction output (txo) to a tweaked transaction output, using a tweaked spend to self

Address 1 : A
Address 2 : A + T

Where T is a tweak of a.

The value of T becomes the on-chain commitmment which observes the git commit

In essence, T = the latest git hash
