## Introduction

Topup is a function of Gitmark that lets you increase the amount of funds in a commitment. This allows a repo to continue operating after it has become low on funds.

## Add another tx input

Simply add another tx input to your transaction, and the new transaction output will have more funds in it.

## Donations

Certain versions of the software may incur donations; this, in turn, could be used to top up the project and keep it going longer.

## Conclusion

Topup is a super simple workflow that sweeps inputs into a new output spliced together with a mark, in order to increase funds on-chain.
