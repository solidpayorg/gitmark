## Schema

The gitmark schema is inspired but [RGB Schemas](https://www.rgbfaq.com/glossary/schema-and-scripts/schema).

## OPS

There are 5 [OPS](./OPS.md) in the schema
- [GENESIS](./GENESIS.md)
- [MARK](./MARK.md)
- [TOPUP](./TOPUP.md)
- [TRANSFER](./TRANSFER.md)
- [EXODUS](./EXODUS.md)

## Crypto

Cryptographic chains use tweaking to transition from one state to another and map to each of the 5 OPS.  

The crypto operations of tweaking, genesis, and so on are described in [CRYPTO](./CRYPTO.md)
