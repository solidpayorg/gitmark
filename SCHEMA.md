## Gitmark Schema

The Gitmark schema is a framework for organizing and tracking changes in a Git repository. It is inspired by the concept of [RGB Schemas](https://www.rgbfaq.com/glossary/schema-and-scripts/schema), which provide a way to represent and validate data in a decentralized network.

## Operations (OPS)

The Gitmark schema defines five core operations (OPS) for managing the state of a Git repository:

1. [GENESIS](./GENESIS.md): Initializes a new Git repository and creates the first commit.
2. [MARK](./MARK.md): Records a specific state or event in the Git repository, such as a milestone or release.
3. [TOPUP](./TOPUP.md): Adds new funds or resources to the Git repository, such as through a crowdfunding campaign or sponsorship.
4. [TRANSFER](./TRANSFER.md): Moves funds or resources from one part of the Git repository to another, such as between different branches or accounts.
5. [EXODUS](./EXODUS.md): Closes out a Git repository and transfers any remaining funds or resources to a designated recipient.

## Cryptographic Operations

The Gitmark schema uses cryptographic operations to ensure the integrity and security of the Git repository. These operations include:

1. Tweaking: A process for transitioning from one state to another in the Git repository, using cryptographic techniques to ensure that the transition is valid and secure.
2. Genesis: The creation of a new Git repository, using cryptographic techniques to establish the initial state and ensure that it is secure.
3. And other cryptographic operations as described in [CRYPTO](./CRYPTO.md)

The Gitmark schema maps each of these cryptographic operations to the corresponding OPS, ensuring that the Git repository is managed in a secure and consistent manner.

By following the Gitmark schema, developers can ensure that their Git repositories are well-organized, secure, and easy to manage. The schema provides a clear framework for tracking changes and managing resources, making it easier to collaborate and build high-quality software.
